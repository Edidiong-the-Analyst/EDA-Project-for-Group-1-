# EDA-Project-SuperStore_Analysis
This is an EDA project on Super-Store Dataset (E-commerce data) using Python. 

PROBLEM STATEMENT DEFINITION
The Dataset chose for this project is an e-commerce dataset. The Problem Statement is “How to Increase Business Revenue of Enny’s Super Stores”.

THE SCENARIO
Enny’s Super Stores operating within the US has given the task to identify what works best for them in terms of sales and making profit. 
Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) we will help them identify:

1. Their most and least profitable product categories
2. Segment analysis of sales and profit
3. Geographical analysis of sales and profit

Given the insights gained from the EDA, the superstore can choose to remove non-profitable products or invest in marketing efforts for products, segments 
and geographical areas that are driving their profit.

UNDERSTANDING THE PROBLEM STATEMENT
To effectively understand the business problem, a root-cause analysis was carried out (using the 5-whys approach). To achieve the above stated objectives, 
some questions have to be answered, like:

1.	What is the profit trend of the business from 2014-2017?
2.	What shipping mode is mostly used?
3.	What product category generates highest revenue?
4.	What Customer Segment generates highest revenue?
5.	Is discount rate dependent on customers’ patronage rate? Does discount rate encourage more sales?
6.	What State and Region has the highest sales and profit generation?

This analysis is aimed at understanding the customers’ preference in terms of products, shipping mood, and number of customers per segment, in order to promote 
targeted business campaign for Increased Revenue and Business Expansion.

Summary of Insights

	 Product Analysis
